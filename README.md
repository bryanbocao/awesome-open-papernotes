# Awesome Open Papernotes

This idea of paper notes was inspired by [Hongjie Peng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vr8W0MgAAAAJ&hl=en), and the methodology of taking notes was inspired by [Qi Zeng](https://github.com/pkuzengqi), [Daniel Seita](https://github.com/DanielTakeshi/Paper_Notes), [Adrian Colyer](https://blog.acolyer.org/about/) and [Denny Britz](https://github.com/dennybritz/deeplearning-papernotes).

This repo contains my notes for research papers that I've read.

#### Rubrics from ```Y2021```:
Papers are numbered on a ```1``` to ```5``` scale in the following aspects:
- ```C```: I understand the research problem and **C**hallenges.
- ```M```: I understand the **M**ain idea and the main contributions to the literature.
- ```E```: I am familiar with the details of **E**xperiments.
- ```L```: I am able to find out the **L**imitations of the proposed method.

#### Rubrics before ```Y2021```:
Papers are numbered on a (1) to (5) scale where

- (1) means I have only barely skimmed it or listened to the presentation.
- (2) means (1) + I understand the main idea and the main contributions to the literature.
- (3) means (2) + related works.
- (4) means (3) + details of the experiments.
- (5) means (4) + I feel confident that I understand almost everything about the paper.

In addition, (0) is used simply to indicate papers that are in the "toread" list.

Each note contains ```C```, ```M```, ```L``` in ```Rubrics from Y2021``` and **takeaways**.

In terms of articles or research posts that are not published in peer review conference or journel, they are numbered on a (1) to (5) scale as well to indicate the extent to which I understand the content.

All papers are included in my previous repo [papers](https://github.com/BryanBo-Cao/papers), which is set to private since it contains papers that need purchased. However, the original papers that are public available without purchasing can be found in the link along with the title of the paper.
